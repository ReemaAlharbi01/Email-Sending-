# Email-Sending-
When I was having a hard time copying and pasting emails from text files and Excel, I realized that Python could be a lifesaver. In this code, I achieved the following using Python:

Extracted and read the emails.
Split the emails by new lines and commas.
Added the emails to a list.
Used smtplib, ssl, MIMEMultipart, and MIMEText to log in to the email and send the message securely.
